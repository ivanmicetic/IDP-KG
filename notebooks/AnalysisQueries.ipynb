    "In this notebook we supply a user interface to query the IDP-KG from a set of predefined queries. The IDP knowledge graph was constructed from Bioschemas markup embedded in DisProt, MobiDb, and Protein Ensemble Database (PED) that was harvested using the Bioschemas Markup Scraper and Extractor and converted into a knowledge graph using the process in this [notebook](https://github.com/AlasdairGray/IDPcentral/blob/main/notebooks/ETLProcess.ipynb). \n",

    "The available queries can be grouped as discussed in the following subsections."

    "As part of the W3C Health Care and Life Sciences Interest Group [guidelines for dataset descriptions](https://www.w3.org/TR/hcls-dataset/), they provided a set of queries that provide useful statistics to understand a dataset. The queries range from providing basic statistics such as number of triples, classes, and objects to more complex statistics such as the number of typed objects linked to a property. \n",

    "All 14 queries are available through the interface below:\n",
